# About me

Hi, I'm Jeff Sandberg. I'm a software engineer, an amateur chicken farmer, and father.

I've been a software engineer, professionally, for over 10 years, and an amateur for far longer than that. I cut my professional teeth with Ruby, before moving to Elixir, and picking up a lot of Javascript skills along the way. I aim to be as much of a software generalist as possible, although I do have my blind spots.

When not working, I enjoy projects related to home automation, 3D printing, yard work, DIY, and model rail.

I have a GitHub account, at <https://github.com/paradox460>, and some presence on other social media, such as reddit and hacker news, but generally will stay away from larger platforms such as Facebook or TikTok.

This site is my personal blog. It will mostly be technical articles, but the occasional other subject will creep in. It's powered by the [tableau static-site generator](https://github.com/elixir-tools/tableau), and the [source-code](https://github.com/paradox460/pdx.su) is readily available, and pull requests are welcome, where appropriate.

Occasionally I'll link out with an Amazon affiliate link, these are disclosed by an Amazon icon at the end of the link, and the affiliate disclaimer message will appear at the bottom of every blogpost that has any such links in them. When you click through these links, and make a purchase on Amazon.com, I may earn a small commission.

If you would like to contact me, you can email me at <jeff@pdx.su>. I won't promise a response, but I will, _eventually_, read your message.
